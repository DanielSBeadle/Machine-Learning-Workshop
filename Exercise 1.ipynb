    "**In this workshop, your job is to train a machine learning algorithm to rate wines on a scale from 1 to 10. Since the algorithm can't taste the wines itself, you are provided with a file containing the properties of the wines, as well as ratings given by a wine expert. Your task is to train a machine learning algorithm to give ratings to wines as similarly as possible to the expert. At the end of the workshop, you will all submit an algorithm. I will run that algorithm on a separate dataset rated by the same expert. Whoever's algorithm is closest to the expert's predictions will be crowned the champion of the machine learning workshop!**"
